# Week 8 - Object-Oriented Programming

A C# console application demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts.

## What It Does

This program uses a custom `GiftSuggestion` class to suggest gifts based on a friend's interests (Marvel, coding, gaming, books, or animals). It demonstrates class instantiation, constructors, methods, and encapsulation. The program also uses input validation with `int.TryParse()` and iterates over a checklist array with `foreach`.

## How to Run

```bash
cd week-8-oop
dotnet run
```
