# Week 5 - Methods

A C# console application demonstrating methods with parameters and return values.

## What It Does

This program prompts the user to enter how many pounds of various Thanksgiving leftovers they have. It uses a custom `CalculateMealPortions()` method that accepts a `double` parameter and returns an `int` representing the number of meals. Based on the meal count, it provides suggestions on what to do with the leftovers.

## How to Run

cd week-5-methods
dotnet run
```
