# Week 7 - Debugging

A C# console application demonstrating exception handling with `try/catch/finally` blocks.

## What It Does

This program prompts the user to enter the number of participants in a gift exchange (1-20). It demonstrates input validation, exception handling for `FormatException` and `OverflowException`, and uses arrays with `Random` to assign gifts. The `finally` block ensures a completion message is always displayed, regardless of errors.

## How to Run

```bash
cd week-7-debug
dotnet run
```
